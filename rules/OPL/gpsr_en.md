# General Purpose Service Robot - GPSR

Reference video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef1RzF9Wj9U

> [!WARNING]
> This is a sample video for reference.
The task content may differ from that year's rules.


## Description

The robot is asked to understand and execute commands requiring a wide range of different abilities.

- **Main Goal**: Execute 3 commands requested by the operator.

- **Optional Goals**: Understand a command given by a default operator.

## Focus

*Task planning*, *object/people detection and recognition*, *object feature recognition*, *object manipulation*


## Setup

- **Locations**:
  - **Task location**: The task takes place inside the *Arena*, but some commands may require the robot to go out.
  The *Arena* is in its nominal state for this task.
  - **Start Location**: The robot starts from a *predefined location* announced during the *Setup Days*.
  When the `TC` gives the *start signal*, the robot moves towards the *Instruction Point*.
  - **Instruction Point**: At the beginning of the test, as well as after finishing the first and second command, the robot moves to the *Instruction Point*.
  The *Instruction Point* is announced during the *Setup Days*.
- **People**:
  - **Host**: The *host* instructs the robot commands given by the `TC`.
  The *default host* is a `TC` member.
  However, the competing team can decided whether to choose an *internal host* (member of the competing team) before the task begins during the *Setup*.
  In such case, DEM scoring deduction will be applied.
  - **Guests**: Guests interact with the robot through gestures and other means depending on the selected task.
  Also, the number of guests will vary based on the selected commands, typically ranging from 1 to 5.

## Procedure

1. **Start Phase**

    1. **Task Time**: The time limit is **ten (10) minutes**.

    1. **Setup**: The `TC` instructs the team to move the robot to the *Start Location*.

    1. **Category Selection**: The team tells the `TC` the selected category.
    Depending on the category, the `TC` will choose an arbitrary command and share its content with the *host*.
        - **DEM Category**: Instructions with pre-defined sentence structure.
        - **Regular Category**: Instructions generated from the [Command Generator - Branch: rcj25_for_opl](https://github.com/RoboCupAtHomeJP/CommandGenerator/tree/rcj25_for_opl).

    1. **Start**: The `TC` gives the *start signal* and starts the timer.
    The team completes the setup (pressing the start button, etc.) and leaves the area.
    **No complex setup procedures are allowed, such as pressing two or more buttons.**

    1. **Pausing the Timer**: The `TC` pause the timer as soon as the robot reaches the *Instruction Point* to give time to set up the arena for the next command.
    The timer resumes as soon as the `host` steps back in front of the robot for the next command.

    1. **Goal**: The robot performs the command phase and service phase for **three (3) times**.

1. **Command Phase**

    1. **Navigation to Host**: The robot navigates to the *Instruction Point*.

    1. **Instruct the Robot**: Once the `TC` has finished setting up the *Arena* for the next command, the *host* commands the given task from the `TC` to the robot.
    If the robot cannot understand the command, the robot can request the *host* to repeat the command and no penalty is given.

1. **Service Phase**

    1. **Command Confirmation**: After receiving the command from the *host*, the robot needs to confirm the command before starting to execute the task.

    1. **Command Execution**: The robot performs the task given in the command.


## Additional Rules and Remarks

### Command Generator

Commands are generated using the [Command Generator - Branch: rcj25_for_opl](https://github.com/RoboCupAtHomeJP/CommandGenerator/tree/rcj25_for_opl).
The `TC` generates arbitrarily the commands in advance to confirm the commands are correct according to the environment.

If the team chooses *DEM Category*, while maintaining impartiality, the command given will be prepared in advance and based on the [DEM Category Sentence Structure](#dem-category-sentence-structure). 


### Skipping Commands - 1.5 Rule

The competing team is able to skip to the next command if the robot misunderstood the given command by the *host*.

In order to skip the command, the **1.5 Rule** will be applied.
This rule makes sure that the competing team is not taking advantage from the skipping rule.

The **1.5 Rule** applies as follows:
- the robot seems to confirm that the mistaken command is correct during the *command confirmation*,
- the robot continues to the *command execution*,
- the robot completes the *Step 1* defined in the section [Steps per Category](#steps-per-category),
- the robot completes or tries to complete the *Step 2* (e.g. failing to grasp an object, to following a person...),
- only then the robot is allowed to go back to the *Instruction Point* to request another task.


### Restart

Restarts are handled depending on the failure Step.
In any case, the robot needs to start from the *Start Location*.
If the robot has completed *Step 1* defined in the section [Steps per Category](#steps-per-category), the robot can **continue** the uncompleted task after restarting without starting again from the *Start Location*.
However, the first score earned right after the restart is reduced to half as a penalty.

If restart is decided to be done:
- During the *Command Confirmation* of the $n(\le 2)$ th command,
  - Restart from the beging of the $n$ th command.
- During the execution of *Step 1* for the $n$ th command
(the team is not ready to move to the next Step 2 due to failure),
  - Restart from the beging of the $n$ th command.
- After completing *Step 1* for the $n'(\le 3)$ th command,
  - Resume from the $n'$ th command from the Step that was not completed.

> [!NOTE]
> If the robot is holding an object, the team decides whether to keep it or put it back.


## Deus Ex Machina

If the *Deus Ex Machina* listed in the *General Rules* is used during the execution of a task, points are deducted, up to ten (10) times.

For example:
- bypassing speech recognition by using an alternative HRI,
- receiving human assistance to accomplish a task,
- instructing a human assistant to perform the whole task

Moreover, the teams are allowed to lower the difficulty of the *Regular Category* by choosing *DEM Category*.
However, the given points will be reflected based on its weight, defined on [Weights per Category](#weights-per-category).
